# Sharing
As per dymanoid's and Gness Erquint's [discussion](http://archive.md/YFGLT) anyone can freely share or modify the original mod. That applies to this version as well. 

I included dymanoid's licence and kept any copyright mentions as this is mostly his work.

# Future updates
No future updates are guaranteed, but I will do what I can.

Use Issues to report bugs related to this fork and to request merging updates from original mod. For any other changes contact dymanoid.
